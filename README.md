# Merging_Data_with_Python
This project explains how to merge two separate data sets in python. 
In this project, Python is used as the programming language to merge two datasets, df1 and df2, using the merge() function from the Pandas library. Python's versatility and extensive functions make it a popular choice among data analysts. The merge() function allows datasets to be combined into a single dataset using different merge types: inner, outer, left, and right. Inner merge displays only the common data between the two datasets, while left merge keeps all data from the left dataset and merges data between the two datasets on the specified column. Right merge does the same but keeps all data from the right dataset. Outer merge displays all data from both datasets. The process involves importing the datasets using pandas and specifying the column to merge on. The resulting merged dataset is assigned to df3. The default merge type is inner, but for this project, an outer merge is applied to preserve all information. The head() function is used to display the first few rows of the merged dataset, and suffixes and indicator parameters can be used to customize the output.
